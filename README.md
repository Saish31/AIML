#**Credit Score Prediction**  

##**Project Overview**  
This project aims to predict a customer's credit score based on historical financial data and behavioral patterns. The model categorizes credit scores into three classes: Good, Standard, and Poor, enabling financial institutions to make informed decisions. The implementation leverages CatBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm, for its ability to handle categorical and text data effectively.  

##**Results**  
- Accuracy: 81%
- Precision: High precision for "Standard" and "Poor" classes; moderate for "Good."
- Recall: Excellent identification of "Poor" credit scores.
- F1 Score: Balanced across all classes, indicating a strong trade-off between precision and recall.
